    <h2 class="text-center display-4 pt-4 pt-md-0">Dessarian Valley</h2>
    <div class="px-5 px-md-0 py-0">
      <p>The Dessarin Valley encompasses the area surrounding the huge river that is its name. Stretching from the western borders of the High Forest and south from Yartar to the Ardeep Forest, the Dessarin Valley holds sights of interest to both travelers and adventurers alike.</p>

      <p>The Dessarin Valley these days is a lightly settled region of caravan towns, isolated homesteads, and uninhabited wilderness just a week’s journey from Waterdeep. Residents in places such as Red Larch or Triboar boast that their humble settlements are “the Gateway to the North.” Through these lands pass hundreds of caravans and keelboats each year, linking the great ports of Waterdeep and Neverwinter with places such as Everlund, Mirabar, or Silverymoon. The steady caravan traffic breathes life into the towns of this area, supporting businesses in the settlements along the Long Road. Inns cater to travelers anxious to sleep safely within sturdy walls and enjoy good food by a warm fire instead of camping by the side of the road.</p>

      <p>When humankind first explored the North, they chose the surprisingly fertile Dessarin delta for their first settlements. To this date, more humans live in the long, broad valley of the Dessarin than in any other part of the Savage Frontier. The farms and ranches of the delta feed the North, nourishing remote mining settlements as well as the orc hordes that sweep down the Dessarin every decade or so.</p>

      <p>The Long Road, running parallel to the river along the west side, is definitely the best road in the North. Much of interest may be found along this avenue. Travelers are advised not to hunt large game on lands claimed by a lord or village. It is also highly inadvisable to take down cattle or trample crops in any case. Small foraging vermin of the sort that consume crops, however, may be freely killed and eaten.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Red Larch</h2>
      <p class="px-5">The town of Red Larch was a waystop on the Long Road seven days north of Waterdeep, and was located at the intersection of three trails. One trail led to the Bargewright Inn, another to Kheldell, and the third ran into the hills to derelict, monster-infested keeps. The town was named for a stand of red larch trees that were chopped down about the time of the town's founding. Red Larch is where our story begins. There was trouble in and around the town.</p>

      <p class="px-5">Beliard is a small, trading village that was home to, as well as a meeting place for, the many cattle ranchers that drove their herds across the nearby hills. This is the last place that the Delegates from Mirabar were seen before travelling south. The group stopped here quickly to rest and find out more information on the Delegates whereabouts</p>

      <p class="px-5">Womford is a tiny village on the banks of the River Dessarin that has many cottages and a bustling dock area. It was formerly known as Ironford, a bridge that crossed the Dessarin. It was a part of the Iron Road. The party travelled here in hopes of finding passage up the river but instead commandeered a keelboat.</p>

      <p class="px-5">Summit Hall was a base and training monastery for the Knights of Samular, an order dedicated to Tyr, god of justice. It was founded by Samular Caradoon. The occupants of Summit Hall grow their own food and maintained watch over nearby lands. They were always ready for battle, and fully armed and armored if encountered outside their walls.</p>

      <p class="px-5">Stone Bridge was a bridge located along the River Dessarin, connecting Red Larch and the Long Road via the Stone Trail to Beliard. The bridge, which was also a temple to Moradin, was a single arch, 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) in length and 400 feet (120 meters) in height, made of granite, roughly six paces wide, with no railings or barriers.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Sumber Hills</h2>
      <p class="px-5">The Sumber Hills are a range of rough hills in the middle of the Dessarin Valley. The River Dessarin flowed through the hills, providing a source of water travel between Yartar and downstream communities such as Beliard, Bargewright Inn, and Womford. The Larch Path and the Dessarin Road provided passage through the hills.</p>
