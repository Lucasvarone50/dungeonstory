    	<h3 class="display-4 text-center mb-3">INTRODUCTION</h3>
    	<div class="px-md-5">
         <p class="intro">A terrible threat gathers in the North. Throughout the Dessarian Valley savage marauders bring destruction. Monsters are on the prowl, preying on flocks, rampaging through croplands, and attacking homesteads and travelers. In settlements, discord and suspicion grow. Sinister strangers lurk in the shadows, whispering about how everything is soon to change. Rumours of Elemental Evil has surfaced in the world. Talk is spreading fast of the return of certain evil elemental cults that seek to master elemental magic and unleash its destructive power everywhere. It’s said that the leaders of the cults wield powerful weapons that they use to harness the power of the elements.</p>
         <h4>Cult of the Black Earth</h4>
         <p>The earth cult worships the implacable strength and unyielding resistance of elemental earth. Cultists seek the power to destroy the works of civilization with landslides, sinkholes, or mighty earthquakes, thus demonstrating the true power of elemental earth and the futility of resistance.
		</p>
		<h4>Cult of the Crushing Wave</h4>
		<p>Cultists of the Crushing Wave worship the awesome power of water, from the surging tides and deadly maelstroms of the sea to the raging torrents of rivers in flood and the rock-scrushing power of ice and glaciers. It is the duty of Crushing Wave initiates to return nonbelievers to the primal waters by drowning them or shedding their blood.</p>
		<h4>Cult of the Howling Hatred</h4>
		<p>The followers of elemental air call themselves the Cult of the Howling Hatred. They worship the destructive power of wind and storms, believing that those who venerate elemental air gain the power to punish those who have wronged them. More so than the members of the other cults, air cultists see their beliefs as a means to an end. Destruction for its own sake isn't particularly interesting, but destruction as an expression of personal freedom or to earn things wrongfully denied? Thats a different story.</p>
		<h4>Cult of the Eternal Flame</h4>
		<p>The followers of the Eternal Flame cult worship the destructive power of fire in all its manifestations. They seek the power to burn away the "corruption" of both civilization and nature with volcanic eruptions, forest fires, heat waves, and droughts, creating a wasteland of ash and cinders ruled by fire alone. Eternal Flame cultists believe the world and all its peoples are wicked and malformed, and they consider it a sacred duty to "purify" everything around them by reducing their surroundings to smoking cinders.</p>
		<p class="intro">Though the rumours of the 4 cults have all but been confirmed no one knows where the cultists gather and practice their maleficent magic and no one knows if other elemental forces are being harnessed for evil. The scattered towns and isolated homesteads of this frontier now face a dire threat. If the forces of Elemental Evil can’t be defeated before they grow, madness and destruction could spread unchecked in the north.</p>
		<p class="intro">Your adventure begins with your arrival to a small settlement called Red Larch on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. Strange rumors and ominous signs have the townsfolk concerned, including reports of bandit attacks on the roads, piracy on the Dessarin River, and monster sightings too close to town. And Where there is trouble there is need for brave adventurers ...and probably some treasure too.</p>

		    	 <button class="text-center portal" data-toggle="popover" title="" data-content="Our party's story began when the 5 adventurers, unbeknownst to eachother, arrived at Red Larch at night with a caravan. Right outside the towns gates a band of goblins attacked and the party quickly sprung into action to defeat them. When the party reached town they were greeted by Harburk, the chief guard of town. Harburk heard the commotion and when he realizes the groups bravery he hired them to take care of a bandit problem to the east of town. The group introduced themselves to eachother over few drinks before settling in at the Swinging Sword Inn. The next day the group explored the town and discovered more troubling news about trouble at a nearby Tomb and Lance Rock. After exploring town the group headed east and killed the bandits camped out close to the road. The bandits had a bear captured in a cage but the group was able to scare the bear away without killing it.

They heard from the baker in town that his daughter was spooked by what she thought was a ghost out front of the tomb so they sought to investigate with hopes of finding some treasure. The group arrived at the tomb and found 2 goblins and a half ogre watching the entrance. After killing the enemies they headed into the tomb to investigate. Inside, they were attacked by 2 spectres after touching a door with an unidenfiable name. After defeating the spectres, the group spoke the name of the hero, Licht Maballs, who is burried in the tomb and the doors opened. Inside the heros tomb the group fought a flying sword and axe that upon defeating turned out to be the Sword of the Sun and the Axe of the Moon."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

The next day the inn keeper, Khallessa, offered the group 40gp to investigate a cave in Lance Rock that she was suspicion of. The group headed south of town to Lance Rock and upon arriving found the cave was infested with zombies and skeletons. When the group reached the end of the cave they ran into a necormancer named Orieoth who had proclaimed himself as Lord of Lance Rock. The group defeated the necormancer and found a wand of magic missile and bag of holding in his chamber. After clearing out the cave the group the group headed back to Red Larch to claim their reward and rest. While resting in the inn they overheard the foreman of the mines talking about masked figures lurking near the mine entrance."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

		    	 <button class="text-center portal" data-toggle="popover" title="" data-content="After hearing about the suspicios figures near the mines, the group headed there at night to stake out the entrance hoping to find clues. They did not find anything in particular but the next morning they awoke to tremor and screams from the middle of town. A sinkhole had opened and several children fell in. While trying to help the children some of the town elders were acting vers suspiciosly. The group quickl realized that the sink hole opened into a larger chamber where there was a man made door. Upon investigating they found ancient dwarf ruins. In the ruins they came across 2 dead bodies with giant rats eating them, a child being punished a half orc guarding the main room, several hooded figures that attacked on site and a town elder named Baragusta that revealed the corrupted secret society in Red Larch called the Believers. The final room of the temple opened up into massive room with floating rocks and a console. The group inspected the console and figured out the puzzle that animated a giant stone statue in the middle of the room. At that point, Larrakh revealed himself and fought the intruders. Once Larrakh was defeated the group exposed the secrets of the Believers to Harburk and the town and the members who were captured were banished from town. Red Larch was effectviely saved."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

				<button class="text-center portal"data-toggle="popover" title="" data-content="The evil lurking in and around Red Larch had been eradicated but trouble was still amis in the Dessarian Valley. Rumours were spreading of a delegation of dwarves, that supposedly had graive information, from Mirabar that went missing. The party set out to find the delegates in hopes that they could find more information about the cultists in the area. They started by traveling to Beliard where they were last seen. On their travels through the Sumber Hills they were stopped and tested by knights on giant vultures who invited them to Feathergale Spire, their headquarters. The group reached Feathergale Spire where Veredin was reunited with an old friend Savra, a noble from Water Deep. After meeting the Knights leader Thurl the group decided to stay at the spire to rest and feast. The next morning the spire was awoken by an attack from a Manticore circling the spire."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

				<button class="text-center portal"data-toggle="popover" title="" data-content="Thurl asked the party if they could hunt the manticore and offered his ring as a reward. The party mounted gryphons that were stabled in the bottom floor of the spire and flew out to hunt the manticore. After an encounter with the manticore, the beast fled. The group tracked the Manticore through the Sighing Valley and found 2 bands of gnolls, a cave with 2 gryphons, a group of native Aarakocra who were keeping watch on the spire and finally the cave where the Manticore was hiding with its mate. The group had a ferocious battle with the Manticores and ended up victorious. After the battle, they harvested the Manticores spikes and cut off their heads as trophies. When flying back to the spire they noticed an area of jagged rocks below the spire with blood splatters, skeletons and scavenger birds but did not investigate further. Dovic collected the reward of a ring of Featherfall from Thurl and the group stayed another night to rest up. That night Tarquin snuck around the spire and found a suspicious note in Thurl’s chamber and overheard Thurl telling Savra that he does not want the group to be apart of the society. The next day the group decided it would be best to leave after Thurl told them about suspicious activity at the Sacred Stone Temple."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

				<button class="text-center portal" data-toggle="popover" title="" data-content="After a day of travelling through the Sumber Hills the group arrived in Beliard where they learned that the delegation had left south almost 10 days earlier. The delegation warned the people of Beliard to prepare for elemental evils that were gathering in the area and said that they had vital information about them. Thus, the group headed south on the path to find the delegation. After several hours of walking they spotted a circle of crows a mile off the road. Upon investigating they found the remains of a battle between armored Mirabar dwarves, bugbears and a masked figure. They followed tracks down to the river where they found what looked like boat landing markings. The party took the mask and headed south towards Summit Hall to further their investigation. Once there they met the knights of Samular and their leader Ushien Stormbanner who directed them towards the Sacred Stone Monastery where she had seen monks wearing masks similar to the ones found at the ambush sight."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

In Womford they tried to find passage up the river but after some miscommunication, found themselves in a fight against thugs on a keelboat. The group killed the thugs, keeping one alive as a prisoner and hijacked their boat. On the bot they found a map with a marking and an x on a location up river. While travelling up river towards the Monastery Namlock charmed their prisoner and extracted information from him about Rivergard Keep. The party docked the boat and headed west to the Monastery. Once there they broke in through the gardens in the back of the area where they were greeted by 2 gargoyles. After defeating the gargoyles they snuck into the Monastery."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

One-by-one Hellenrae, challenged the party until she was worn out. Then, she sent them off to meet the high priest to be outfitted to become monks themselves. The group met the high priest who sent them to the living quarters to sacrifice all of their personal belongings before becoming full-fledged monks and starting their duties. Instead of giving up their belongings, the group opted to kill their escorts and stash their bodies under beds. Tarquin being invisible and Namlock dressed up as a monk decided to investigate the monastery to get a lay of the land but their plan was foiled when Tarquin alerted 2 monks by revealing himself with a flour debacle. The group had no choice but to kill the dark dwarves that roamed the halls near their room and the monks in the kitchen preparing dinner."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>

Before they knew it 8 monks were waiting outside in the dining hall waiting for food. Tarquin and Namlock distracted the monks while the rest of the party snuck out back and flanked them. Veredin kicked in the door and began their ambush. After a hard fought battle that left several of the group members almost dead the party retreated back to their ship to rest. However, upon revisiting the monastery on a late-night mission the party was welcomed by 2 minotaurs  and a monk that were investigating the battle scene."><img src="images/portal1.png"></button>
